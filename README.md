# Cosmology-term-paper
During the cosmology undergraduate course, I prepared this term paper, focusing on the CONCEPT simulation. Through this amazing journey to the world of N-body simulations, I used the Master's thesis of Dr. Jeppe Mosgaard Dakin, named "Computing Dark Universes". Also I used the CONCEPT simulation tutorial to run the recommended simulations.
